    <h2>Structured Summary: Ohm (2012) as Counterpoint</h2>

      Paul Ohm, <em>The Fourth Amendment in a World Without Privacy</em>, 81

      <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2073574">https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2073574</a>

    <h2>Central thesis</h2>
    <p>
        Ohm argues that as the private sector builds a pervasive “surveillance society,” Fourth Amendment doctrine that uses
      “privacy” as its proxy will steadily contract. When people routinely disclose data to devices, platforms, and cloud
      intermediaries, courts applying expectation-of-privacy and “assumption of risk” logic will increasingly treat
      government access to those records as non-search activity. Preserving meaningful limits therefore requires more than
      “mild tweaks” to the third-party doctrine; it requires a “third act” that reorients Fourth Amendment analysis toward
      constraining state power despite declining baseline privacy. (pp. 1309–1312, esp. p. 1311).<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup>
    </p>

    <h2>1) Problem framing: privatized surveillance as a constitutional stress test</h2>
    <p>
        The Introduction frames a two-step dynamic: (i) businesses capture and store granular behavioral data at scale, and
      (ii) law enforcement later obtains those records more easily than it could have collected directly. The constitutional
      risk is structural: the state can become a downstream consumer of private surveillance, while doctrine built around
      “reasonable expectations” treats widespread disclosure as forfeiture of protection. On this view, the Fourth Amendment
      can “shrink” not because courts affirmatively expand police powers, but because private data practices redefine what
      counts as “reasonable” privacy in the first place. (pp. 1310–1312).<sup id="fnref3"><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup>
    </p>

    <h2>2) Part I — “The Death of Privacy”: why private surveillance becomes ubiquitous</h2>
    <p>
        Ohm sets the predicate for doctrinal erosion by explaining why private surveillance becomes ambient and hard to avoid.
      He identifies four reinforcing drivers: “the one device” (smartphones as always-on sensors that travel everywhere),
      “the cloud” (cheap storage and processing that makes retention default), “the social” (platform incentives and network
      effects that normalize sharing), and “Big Data” (analytics that extract value from scale and correlation). Together,
      these forces yield a “surveillance society,” where collection is continuous, secondary use is routine, and opting out
      is increasingly costly or unrealistic. (pp. 1314–1320).<sup id="fnref4"><a href="#fn4">4</a></sup>
    </p>

    <h2>3) Part II — “The Diminished Fourth Amendment”: why privacy-based doctrine fails</h2>
    <p>
        Part II argues that privacy-centered Fourth Amendment doctrine—especially under <em>Katz</em>—can become self-defeating
      when privacy is already collapsing. Ohm first critiques “self-help” assumptions: avoidance, secrecy, and individual
      choice cannot realistically counter pervasive tracking embedded in ordinary devices and services. He then describes
      the “no more expectations of privacy” trap: when courts treat widespread disclosure as “assumption of risk” or “knowing
      exposure,” diminished social privacy becomes the doctrinal reason to diminish constitutional protection. The result is
      a feedback loop: more private surveillance leads to less constitutional coverage for government access to the products
      of that surveillance. He therefore urges a pivot “from privacy to power”—treating the Fourth Amendment as a structural
      check on state coercion and informational dominance, rather than a mirror of prevailing privacy norms. (pp. 1320–1336).<sup id="fnref5"><a href="#fn5">5</a></sup>
    </p>

    <h2>4) Part III — “The Fourth Amendment’s Third Act”: what comes after Katz</h2>
    <p>
        Ohm’s constructive proposal begins with a reframing: <em>Katz</em> is becoming “the new <em>Olmstead</em>”—a once-dominant
      framework that becomes brittle as technology and social practice change. From there, he develops “equilibrium
      adjustment” as a method: courts should preserve the constitutional balance between police power and citizen liberty as
      technology shifts investigative capabilities, tightening or relaxing rules as the playing field changes. Because
      equilibrium talk can be indeterminate, he argues for more objective metrics—measurable changes in investigative
      difficulty or policing capacity—to discipline when adjustment is warranted, rather than relying solely on intuition
      about “reasonable” expectations. (pp. 1336–1347).<sup id="fnref6"><a href="#fn6">6</a></sup>
    </p>

    <h2>5) Conclusion: what survives when “privacy” no longer does</h2>
    <p>
        Ohm concludes that if Fourth Amendment protection is tethered only to expectations of privacy, then pervasive private
      surveillance will predictably generate weaker constitutional limits on government access to personal data. The durable
      project, on his account, is not to “restore” lost privacy by doctrinal fiat, but to maintain meaningful constitutional
      constraints on state power in a society where private actors routinely collect what the government wants. (pp. 1353–1356).<sup id="fnref7"><a href="#fn7">7</a></sup>
