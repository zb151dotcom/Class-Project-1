  <h2>Central thesis</h2>
  <p>
    Ohm argues that as the private sector builds a pervasive “surveillance society,” Fourth Amendment doctrine that uses
    “privacy” as its proxy will steadily contract. When people routinely disclose data to devices, platforms, and cloud
    intermediaries, courts applying expectation-of-privacy and “assumption of risk” logic will increasingly treat
    government access to those records as non-search activity. Preserving meaningful limits therefore requires more than
    “mild tweaks” to the third-party doctrine; it requires a “third act” that reorients Fourth Amendment analysis toward
    constraining state power despite declining baseline privacy. (<span class="page">pp. 1309–1312</span>, esp.
    <span class="page">p. 1311</span>)
  </p>

  <h2>1) Problem framing: privatized surveillance as a constitutional stress test</h2>
  <p>
    The Introduction frames a two-step dynamic: (i) businesses capture and store granular behavioral data at scale, and
    (ii) law enforcement later obtains those records more easily than it could have collected directly. The
    constitutional risk is structural: the state can become a downstream consumer of private surveillance, while
    doctrine—built around “reasonable expectations”—treats widespread disclosure as forfeiture of protection.
    (<span class="page">pp. 1310–1312</span>)
  </p>

  <h2>2) Part I — “The Death of Privacy”: why private surveillance becomes ubiquitous</h2>
  <p>
    Ohm sets the predicate for doctrinal change by identifying four reinforcing drivers: “the one device” (smartphones
    as always-on sensors), “the cloud” (cheap storage/processing), “the social” (normalized sharing and network
    effects), and “Big Data” (analytics that extract value from scale). (<span class="page">pp. 1314–1318</span>). These
    forces culminate in the “surveillance society,” where collection and retention are routine and opting out is
    increasingly unrealistic. (<span class="page">pp. 1318–1320</span>)
  </p>

  <h2>3) Part II — “The Diminished Fourth Amendment”: why privacy-based doctrine fails</h2>
  <p>
    Ohm argues that privacy-centered Fourth Amendment doctrine—especially through <em>Katz</em>—breaks down once
    surveillance is ambient and intermediated. He first critiques “self-help” assumptions: avoidance, secrecy, or
    individual choice cannot plausibly counter pervasive, networked tracking. (<span class="page">pp. 1321–1325</span>).
    He then explains the “no more expectations of privacy” trap: when courts treat ubiquitous disclosure as “assumption
    of risk” or “knowing exposure,” reduced social privacy becomes the doctrinal reason to reduce constitutional
    protection. (<span class="page">pp. 1325–1332</span>). He ends by urging a pivot “from privacy to power”—treating the
    Fourth Amendment as a structural check on state coercion and information dominance, not merely a mirror of prevailing
    privacy norms. (<span class="page">pp. 1334–1336</span>)
  </p>

  <h2>4) Part III — “The Fourth Amendment’s Third Act”: what comes after Katz</h2>
  <p>
    Ohm’s constructive proposal has two main moves. First, “Katz is the new Olmstead”: <em>Katz</em>’s privacy-proxy
    framework becomes brittle once privacy is systematically undermined by private infrastructure.
    (<span class="page">p. 1336</span>). Second, he develops “equilibrium adjustment” as a method: courts should preserve
    the constitutional balance between police power and citizen liberty as technology changes, tightening or relaxing
    rules as the investigative playing field shifts. (<span class="page">pp. 1339–1347</span>). Because equilibrium talk
    can be indeterminate, he argues for objective metrics—measurable changes in investigative difficulty or policing
    capacity—to discipline when adjustment is warranted. (<span class="page">pp. 1341–1346</span>). He also gestures
    beyond a warrant/probable-cause-only toolkit to additional constraints calibrated to the modern data ecosystem.
    (<span class="page">pp. 1347–1352</span>)
  </p>

  <h2>5) Conclusion: what survives when “privacy” no longer does</h2>
  <p>
    Ohm concludes that a Fourth Amendment anchored solely to privacy expectations risks perverse results as baselines
    shift: deep digital surveillance becomes easy to justify while other investigative choices look irrationally
    constrained. The durable project, on his account, is not to “restore” lost privacy by doctrinal fiat, but to maintain
    constitutional limits on state power in a society where private actors routinely collect what the government wants.
