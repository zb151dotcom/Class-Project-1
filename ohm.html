    <h2>Structured Summary: Ohm (2012) as Counterpoint</h2>
    <p class="subtle">Ohm argues Fourth Amendment doctrine collapses if “privacy” collapses; the solution must constrain state power even in a surveillance society.</p>

    <p>
      Paul Ohm, <em>The Fourth Amendment in a World Without Privacy</em>, 81
      <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">MISS. L.J.</span> 1309 (2012),
      https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2073574 [https://perma.cc/WJG9-Q24Y].
    </p>

    <div class="label">Central Thesis</div>
    <p>
      Ohm argues that as the private sector builds a pervasive “surveillance society,” Fourth Amendment doctrine that uses
      “privacy” as its proxy will steadily contract. When people routinely disclose data to devices, platforms, and cloud
      intermediaries, courts applying expectation-of-privacy and “assumption of risk” logic will increasingly treat
      government access to those records as non-search activity. Preserving meaningful limits therefore requires more than
      “mild tweaks” to the third-party doctrine; it requires a “third act” that reorients Fourth Amendment analysis toward
      constraining state power despite declining baseline privacy. (Ohm, supra, at 1310–12).
    </p>

    <div class="label">1) Problem framing: privatized surveillance as a constitutional stress test</div>
    <p>
      The Introduction frames a two-step dynamic: (i) businesses capture and store granular behavioral data at scale, and
      (ii) law enforcement later obtains those records more easily than it could have collected directly. The constitutional
      risk is structural: the state can become a downstream consumer of private surveillance, while doctrine built around
      “reasonable expectations” treats widespread disclosure as forfeiture of protection. (Id. at 1310–12).
    </p>

    <div class="label">2) Part I — “The Death of Privacy”: why private surveillance becomes ubiquitous</div>
    <p>
      Ohm identifies four reinforcing drivers: “the one device” (smartphones as always-on sensors), “the cloud” (cheap
      storage/processing), “the social” (normalized sharing and network effects), and “Big Data” (analytics that extract
      value from scale). These forces yield a “surveillance society,” where collection is continuous, secondary use is
      routine, and opting out is increasingly unrealistic. (Id. at 1314–20).
    </p>

    <div class="label">3) Part II — “The Diminished Fourth Amendment”: why privacy-based doctrine fails</div>
    <p>
      Part II argues that privacy-centered Fourth Amendment doctrine—especially under <em>Katz</em>—can become self-defeating
      when privacy is already collapsing. Ohm critiques “self-help” assumptions as unrealistic against pervasive tracking and
      describes the “no more expectations of privacy” trap: when ubiquitous disclosure is treated as “assumption of risk” or
      “knowing exposure,” diminished social privacy becomes the doctrinal reason to diminish constitutional protection. He
      urges a pivot “from privacy to power.” (Id. at 1320–36; see also <em>Katz v. United States</em>, 389 U.S. 347 (1967).)
    </p>

    <div class="label">4) Part III — “The Fourth Amendment’s Third Act”: what comes after Katz</div>
    <p>
      Ohm suggests <em>Katz</em> is becoming “the new <em>Olmstead</em>” and develops “equilibrium adjustment” as a method:
      courts should preserve the constitutional balance between police power and citizen liberty as investigative capabilities
      shift. (Ohm, supra, at 1336–47; see <em>Olmstead v. United States</em>, 277 U.S. 438 (1928); cf. Orin S. Kerr,
      <em>An Equilibrium-Adjustment Theory of the Fourth Amendment</em>, 125
      <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">HARV. L. REV.</span> 476 (2011).
    </p>

    <div class="label">5) Conclusion: what survives when “privacy” no longer does</div>
    <p>
      Ohm concludes that if Fourth Amendment protection is tethered only to expectations of privacy, pervasive private
      surveillance will predictably generate weaker limits on government access to personal data. (Ohm, supra, at 1353–56).
