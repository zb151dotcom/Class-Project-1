  <h2>Structured Summary: Ohm (2012) as a Counterpoint to Solove</h2>

  <p>
    Paul Ohm, <em>The Fourth Amendment in a World Without Privacy</em>, 81
    <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">MISS. L.J.</span> 1309 (2012),
    https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2073574 [https://perma.cc/WJG9-Q24Y].
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Central thesis.</strong>
    Ohm argues that as the private sector builds a pervasive “surveillance society,” Fourth Amendment doctrine that uses
    “privacy” as its proxy will steadily contract. When people routinely disclose data to devices, platforms, and cloud
    intermediaries, courts applying expectation-of-privacy and “assumption of risk” logic will increasingly treat
    government access to those records as non-search activity. Preserving meaningful limits therefore requires more than
    “mild tweaks” to the third-party doctrine; it requires a “third act” that reorients Fourth Amendment analysis toward
    constraining state power despite declining baseline privacy. (Ohm, supra, at 1310–12)
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>1) Problem framing: privatized surveillance as a constitutional stress test.</strong>
    The Introduction frames a two-step dynamic: (i) businesses capture and store granular behavioral data at scale, and
    (ii) law enforcement later obtains those records more easily than it could have collected directly. The constitutional
    risk is structural: the state can become a downstream consumer of private surveillance, while doctrine built around
    “reasonable expectations” treats widespread disclosure as forfeiture of protection. (Id. at 1310–12.)
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>2) Part I — “The Death of Privacy”: why private surveillance becomes ubiquitous.</strong>
    Ohm identifies four reinforcing drivers: “the one device” (smartphones as always-on sensors), “the cloud” (cheap
    storage/processing), “the social” (normalized sharing and network effects), and “Big Data” (analytics that extract
    value from scale). These forces yield a “surveillance society,” where collection is continuous, secondary use is
    routine, and opting out is increasingly unrealistic. (Id. at 1314–20.)
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>3) Part II — “The Diminished Fourth Amendment”: why privacy-based doctrine fails.</strong>
    Part II argues that privacy-centered Fourth Amendment doctrine—especially under <em>Katz</em>—can become self-defeating
    when privacy is already collapsing. Ohm critiques “self-help” assumptions as unrealistic against pervasive tracking and
    describes the “no more expectations of privacy” trap: when ubiquitous disclosure is treated as “assumption of risk” or
    “knowing exposure,” diminished social privacy becomes the doctrinal reason to diminish constitutional protection. He
    urges a pivot “from privacy to power”—treating the Fourth Amendment as a structural check on state coercion and
    informational dominance, not merely a mirror of prevailing privacy norms. (Id. at 1320–36; see also <em>Katz v. United States</em>, 389 U.S. 347 (1967).)
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>4) Part III — “The Fourth Amendment’s Third Act”: what comes after Katz.</strong>
    Ohm suggests <em>Katz</em> is becoming “the new <em>Olmstead</em>” and develops “equilibrium adjustment” as a method:
    courts should preserve the constitutional balance between police power and citizen liberty as investigative capabilities
    shift. He argues for objective metrics to discipline when adjustment is warranted. (Ohm, supra, at 1336–47;
    see <em>Olmstead v. United States</em>, 277 U.S. 438 (1928); cf. Orin S. Kerr, <em>An Equilibrium-Adjustment Theory of the Fourth Amendment</em>,
    125 <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">HARV. L. REV.</span> 476 (2011).)
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>5) Conclusion: what survives when “privacy” no longer does.</strong>
    Ohm concludes that if Fourth Amendment protection is tethered only to expectations of privacy, pervasive private
    surveillance will predictably generate weaker limits on government access to personal data. The durable project, on his
    account, is maintaining meaningful constitutional constraints on state power in a society where private actors
    routinely collect what the government wants. (Ohm, supra, at 1353–56.)
