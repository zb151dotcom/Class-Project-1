    <p class="subtle">One question designed to force doctrinal application and normative judgment.</p>
    <div class="callout">
      <strong>Question:</strong> In a duty-based risk governance privacy scheme for AI regulation, what should
      be the minimum enforceable obligations for organizations (e.g., impact assessments, auditability, contestability of decisions),
      and who should have standing to enforce them when harms are diffuse or primarily collective?
