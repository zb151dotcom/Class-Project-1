    <h2>Critical Analysis</h2>
    <p class="subtle">Strengths and weaknesses, tied to governance design and enforceability.</p>

    <div class="label">Strengths</div>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Conceptual clarity</strong> — Treating AI as “amplified data practice” avoids hype and keeps human institutions accountable for design and deployment choices.</li>
      <li><strong>Regulatory realism</strong> — The critique of consent-based privacy fits how people actually interact with notice regimes and how opaque ML systems function in practice.</li>
      <li><strong>Actionable roadmap</strong> — Organizing privacy impact by collection, generation (inference), and outcome influence is a useful way to translate technical systems into legal oversight targets.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <div class="label">Weaknesses / Limitations</div>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Operational detail gap</strong> — Structural oversight and risk governance are persuasive in theory, but the hardest questions are administrative: who sets metrics, who audits, what transparency is required, and how regulators scale oversight.</li>
      <li><strong>General-purpose AI problem</strong> — The roadmap flags it, but governance for multipurpose models can become either too broad (stifling) or too narrow (easily evaded through “downstream” deployment).</li>
      <li><strong>Remedy/standing friction</strong> — In U.S. litigation, systemic harms often run into causation and standing barriers; stronger governance may require legislative change, not just doctrinal refinement.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <div class="label">Bottom line</div>
    <p>
      The article’s strongest contribution is reframing AI privacy as a scaling problem that breaks individual control models.
      Its proposed direction—duty-based, risk-oriented governance—sounds right, but success depends on concrete institutional
      design: enforceable standards, audit capacity, and remedies that reach systemic harms rather than isolated individual violations.
