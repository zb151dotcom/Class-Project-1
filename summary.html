    <h2>Structured Summary (500–700 words)</h2>
    <p class="subtle">Solove articulates a framework for analyzing regulatory schemes for AI and highlights areas of concern with the use of AI.</p>

    <div class="label">1) Background / Context</div>
    <p>
      The article develops a framework for understanding how artificial intelligence reshapes privacy law by magnifying familiar
      weaknesses in existing regulatory models. Rather than treating AI as an entirely new legal category, the author emphasizes
      continuity: modern “AI” is largely machine learning that detects patterns in data, enabled by dramatic increases in data
      availability, computing power, and algorithmic sophistication. Because these systems depend on human choices—design,
      training objectives, curated datasets—the author cautions against anthropomorphizing AI in ways that obscure accountability.
      On this view, AI should be understood as the next step in algorithmic data analysis within a longer history of digital data
      practices. That framing matters because policymakers often respond incoherently when they regulate AI as categorically
      exceptional rather than as a set of intensified data-processing techniques.
    </p>

    <div class="label">2) Main Claim / Thesis</div>
    <p>
      The central claim is that AI intensifies long-standing privacy problems—especially those tied to collection, processing,
      and use—so severely that traditional privacy law, and particularly consent-based models, become increasingly ineffective.
      The author argues that frameworks centered on individual control assume people can meaningfully manage their privacy through
      notice and consent, but AI’s scale and inferential capacity make that assumption unrealistic. Even rights-forward regimes
      that provide access, correction, or deletion struggle because AI systems are built on collective datasets and complex models
      that individuals cannot fully understand or control. As AI blurs boundaries between collection, processing, and analysis,
      the law’s categorical triggers and remedial tools fail to track how privacy harms are actually produced.
    </p>

    <div class="label">3) Evidence & Reasoning</div>
    <p>
      The article advances a regulatory roadmap organized around categories of AI-driven privacy impact and compares existing
      approaches across jurisdictions. First, it critiques individual-control regulation (especially prominent in the United
      States) for over-relying on notice and consent. Next, it evaluates harm-based and risk-based approaches—illustrated by
      emerging EU models—arguing that risk-tier governance is more realistic because it focuses on potential harms rather than
      formal consent. Yet risk-based regulation raises difficult design questions: who conducts risk assessments, what level of
      transparency is required, and how to handle general-purpose AI systems that can be repurposed in unexpected contexts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The roadmap then highlights three technical domains that create distinctive privacy risks. (1) <strong>Data collection</strong>:
      AI drives enormous demand for data, often gathered through large-scale scraping or repurposed consumer data, undermining
      transparency, purpose limitation, and data minimization. Aggregation can transform publicly available information into
      invasive surveillance capabilities. (2) <strong>Data generation</strong>: AI can infer new personal information, effectively
      bypassing protections focused on direct collection, and can generate deceptive or harmful simulated content that increases
      risks of manipulation, fraud, and identity distortion. (3) <strong>Outcome influence</strong>: predictive and automated
      systems shape opportunities and constraints, potentially entrenching inequality through biased models, self-fulfilling
      expectations, and depersonalized decisions that ignore context. The author stresses that these issues are not solvable
      solely through technical “bias fixes,” but require governance interventions with enforceable standards.
    </p>

    <div class="label">4) Implications / Takeaways</div>
    <p>
      The article concludes that AI does not invent wholly new privacy problems; it exposes the inadequacy of privacy law built
      around individual data management. The proposed direction is a shift toward structural oversight, risk governance, and
      institutional accountability: substantive duties on organizations, stronger enforcement, stakeholder inclusion in system
      design, and remedies for systemic harms. Transparency and due process become central because complexity and “black box”
      operation make it difficult for individuals to contest automated outcomes. Effective AI governance, on this view, requires
      moving beyond consent toward systemic regulation that prevents harm and assigns responsibility at the institutional level.
